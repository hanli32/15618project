# 15618project
15618 final project

>TA suggestion
1. memory management
2. specialization
3. (extra) more compression methods
4. beat open source version
5. Analysis bottleneck

>New ideas
1. maybe a "deep" understanding of CG would do better: instead of using the final sequential version from wiki, what about design a parallel version based on the algo induction and logics inside?
